 * the ethi.edcldisable signal. Only available if the EDCL hardware is present in the core.
 *
 * ram_debug_enable: Set to one to enable the RAM debug mode. Reset value: ‘0’. Only available
 * if the VHDL generic ramdebug is nonzero.
 *
 * disable_duplex_detection: Disable the EDCL speed/duplex detection FSM. If the FSM cannot
 * complete the detection the MDIO interface will be locked in busy mode. If software needs to access
 * the MDIO the FSM can be disabled here and as soon as the MDIO busy bit is 0 the interface is available
 * Note that the FSM cannot be reenabled again.
 *
 * multicast_enable: Enable reception of multicast addresses. Reset value: ‘0’.
 *
 * phy_int_enable: Enables interrupts for detected PHY status changes.
 *
 * speed: Sets the current speed mode. 0 = 10 Mbit, 1 = 100 Mbit. Only used in RMII mode (rmii = 1).
 * A default value is automatically read from the PHY after reset. Reset value: ‘1’.
 *
 * promiscuous_mode: If set, the GRETH operates in promiscuous mode which means it will
 * receive all packets regardless of the destination address. Reset value: ‘0’.
 *
 * fullduplex_enable: If set, the GRETH operates in full-duplex mode otherwise it operates in half-
 * duplex. Reset value: ‘0’.
 *
 * receiver_int_enable: Enable Receiver Interrupts. An interrupt will be generated each time a
 * packet is received when this bit is set. The interrupt is generated regardless if the packet was
 * received successfully or if it terminated with an error. Reset value: ‘0’.
 *
 * transmitter_int_enable: Enable Transmitter Interrupts. An interrupt will be generated each time a
 * packet is transmitted when this bit is set. The interrupt is generated regardless if the packet was
 * transmitted successfully or if it terminated with an error. Reset value: ‘0’.
 *
 * receiver_enable: Receive enable (RE) - Should be written with a one each time new descriptors are enabled. As long
 * as this bit is one the GRETH will read new descriptors and as soon as it encounters a disabled
 * descriptor it will stop until RE is set again. This bit should be written with a one after the new
 * descriptors have been enabled. Reset value: ‘0’.
 *
 * transmitter_enable: Transmit enable (TE) - Should be written with a one each time new descriptors are enabled. As long
 * as this bit is one the GRETH will read new descriptors and as soon as it encounters a disabled
 * descriptor it will stop until TE is set again. This bit should be written with a one after the new
 * descriptors have been enabled. Reset value: ‘0’.
